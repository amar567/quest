                    As many of you know, there has been a huge surge of research interest in the domain of quantum
                    computation and quantum technology. The Govt. of India also has recently laid down a plan for
                    spending 6000 Cr. rupees for building quantum technology in India. The rapid growth of quantum
                    technologies has created numerous job opportunities in private sectors as well, in India and abroad,
                    and the trend is going only upwards. Entrepreneurship in Quantum Technologies is also flourishing
                    faster than ever.
                    <br />
                    In light of this ongoing second quantum revolution, we are arranging an online Industry-Academia
                    meet-up with the Quantum Industry Stalwarts of India. We encourage all members, especially young
                    students to attend the event who are interested in being part of this technology revolution in
                    India. You will have the opportunity to know what is going on in the quantum industries and interact
                    with the speakers.

                    Quantum Information and Quantum Technology - 2023 (QIQT -2023), marks the fourth workshop in a
                    series conducted during the summer months at the renowned Indian Institute of Science Education and
                    Research Kolkata (IISER-K). Its primary objective is to facilitate face-to-face interactions between
                    leading experts and the next generation of students and young researchers. With a diverse array of
                    participants including Physicists, Chemists, Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, and Engineers,
                    QIQT -2023 promises to be a multidisciplinary platform fostering collaboration and knowledge
                    exchange.
                    <br>
                    During last week of the QIQT-2023, we offer a platform for young researchers to showcase their own
                    contributions, fostering recognition and encouragement for their valuable work.
