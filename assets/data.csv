Such sensors can be based on unitary systems like various types of interferometers or open systems based on scattering and lossy transmission channels. The framework of the quantum Fisher information enables one to obtain best estimates of the parameters and then one can design possible experiments that can reach Cramer- Rao bounds. I would highlight not only the importance of the quantum states used as probes, but also the importance of the quantum-ness of the measurement schemes. The time reversed metrology can be realized by SU11 interferometers. I would bring out the especial importance of the squeezed states of matter and light for metrology and show how the time reversed metrology can saturate Cramer -Rao bounds in many cases.",show,GirishAgarwal,Prof. Girish Agarwal,https://youtube.com/watch?v=KcKRrHF8SeA,38861,Quantum optics

Prof.,Urbasi,Sinha,Raman Research Institute,usinha@rri.res.in,Accepted,,4,5/8/2023,12:00:00,,Quantum Experiments with Satellite Technology,"In India, our Quantum Information and Computing lab at RRI is working on a mega project called Quantum Experiments with Satellite Technology (QuEST) in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organization. This is India’s first satellite based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) project which aims to develop indigenous technologies for satellite based QKD towards a quantum secure future for India. Here, we will report on several milestones achieved by the QuEST project. The first involves the development of a novel, indigenous QKD simulation toolkit qkdSim [1], as well as the establishment of a prepare and measure based QKD experiment. The simulation results match well with experiment; a representative key rate and the quantum bit error rate from experiment is 51±0.5 kbit/sec and 4.79%±0.01% respectively, wherein the simulation yields 52.83±0.36 kbit/sec and 4.79%±0.01%, respectively[2]. With this, we establish a prepare and measure based QKD protocol in the lab with an indigenous novel simulation toolkit, both very important milestones towards our quest for satellite based QKD in India. We will then discuss our demonstration of free space entanglement based quantum communication between two buildings at RRI through an atmospheric channel, the first such demonstration in India, first performed in February 2021. We will then discuss our recent work on passive feedback based polarisation scrambling mitigation, a crucial requirement for long haul quantum communications [3]. One of the major challenges in long distance quantum communications is the polarization degree of freedom of single-photons getting affected while transmission through optical fibres, or atmospheric turbulence. Conventionally, an active feedback-based mechanism is employed to achieve real-time polarization tracking. In this work, we propose an alternative, less resource intensive, passive feedback based approach. As a proof-of- principle demonstration, we implement an in-lab BBM92 protocol to exemplify the performance of our technique.
We will end with our broad vision for the future in terms of a global quantum communication network.

As an example, we consider the interaction of two charges via a mediating quantum field and the resulting interference pattern, in the Lorenz gauge. We propose that detecting relative phases or entanglement between two charges in an interference experiment is equivalent to accessing empirically the gauge degrees of freedom associated with the so-called ghost (scalar) modes of the field in the Lorenz gauge. These results imply that ghost modes are measurable and hence physically relevant, contrary to what is usually thought. They also raise interesting questions about the relation between the principle of locality and the principle of gauge-invariance. Our analysis applies also to linearised quantum gravity in the harmonic gauge, and hence has implications for the recently proposed entanglement-based witnesses of non-classicality in gravity.",show,Vlatko Vedral,Prof. Vlatko Vedral,https://youtube.com/watch?v=xf07BOvwqtA,45097,Quantum Information

Prof.,R P,Singh,"PRL, Ahmedabad",rpkpsingh@gmail.com,Accepted,,16,5/8/2023,16:00:00,,Free space quantum key distribution: India and the World,"Abstract: To provide unconditional security to the keys, and subsequently to the message, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) comes to the rescue. QKD is one of the most ubiquitous applications of quantum mechanics in modern times. Though QKD provides unconditional security, its practical implementation deviates from the ideal one, affecting the security of key. In this talk, we will discuss the techniques to improve the key rates for BB84 and BBM92 QKD protocol and methods to characterize implementation loopholes that make it vulnerable against the side channel attacks. For increasing the key rate using weak coherent laser pulses, we introduce a novel quantum key distribution protocol, called coincidence detection quantum key distribution protocol (CD Protocol). We show that the Poissonian nature of weak coherent pulses instead of posing a security risk can be used to achieve a secure key rate higher than the standard GLLP and decoy state QKD protocols. Prepare and measure protocols such as BB84 consider the satellite as a trusted device, which is fraught with danger looking at the current trend for satellite based optical communication.Therefore, entanglement-based QKD (EB QKD) protocols must be preferred since, along with overcoming the distance limitation, one can take the satellite as an untrusted device. The most well-known EB QKD protocol is the E91 protocol, but the achieved key rate is less as maximum of the bits are sacrificed for measuring Bell parameter. This key rate can be increased without compromising the security provided by EB QKD, if one uses the BBM92 protocol with a pre-characterized relation between S and QBER. Thus, an estimate of QBER provides a simultaneous measurement of entanglement without sacrificing the bits used in proving the Bell’s inequality violation. At the end, we will discuss the current international status of the field.

However, many experiments admit effective descriptions in terms of other state spaces, such as classical probability distributions or quantum systems with superselection rules. Here, we ask which probabilistic theories could reasonably be found as effective descriptions of physical systems if nature is fundamentally quantum. To this end, we employ a generalized version of noncontextuality: processes that are statistically indistinguishable in an effective theory should not require explanation by multiple distinguishable processes in a more fundamental theory. We formulate this principle in terms of embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude of fundamental results on the exact and approximate embedding of theories (in particular into quantum theory). We show how results on Bell inequalities can be used for the robust certification of this generalized notion of contextuality. From this, we propose an experimental test of quantum theory by probing single physical systems without assuming access to a tomographically complete set of procedures, arguably avoiding a significant loophole of earlier approaches.

Prof.,Dipankar,Home,Bose Institute,quantumhome80@gmail.com,Accepted,middle or 3rd week of june,20,,,,Proposing mass-independent test of macrorealism and quantumness of an arbitrarily massive oscillating object,"A cutting-edge research enterprise in contemporary physics is to empirically probe the limits of validity of quantum superposition of states in the macroscopic regime, along with testing the quantum mechanical incompatibility with the basic notion of macrorealism (the assumption that macro-objects can be assigned definite properties, independent of measurement), both of which have deep-seated foundational implications. The goal is to expand as much possible the macroscopic domain of such tests. Broadly speaking, these tests probe the quantum-classical boundary in terms of superposition of macroscopically distinct states (Schrödinger cat-type states), a line of study which can even have practical applications like for quantum sensing, apart from providing empirical constraints on various modifications of quantum dynamical evolution in the macrolimit that have been proposed towards addressing the quantum measurement problem. Against this backdrop, our work discussed in the present talk formulates a testable example in which an inherent quantumness of a massive harmonically oscillating object can be demonstrated in a way which has the following three key advantages:<br/> (i) The magnitude of quantumness evidenced through the predicted violation of a suitable macrorealist condition (like the Leggett-Garg inequality, or the no-signalling in time condition) is independent of mass. Such violation is also predicted to be independent of the other relevant experimental parameters like the oscillation frequency and momentum, dependent only on the choice of instants of the measurements. Thus, the implied operational flexibility would greatly facilitate in scaling up the test of macrorealism and quantumness, all the way to considerably large masses. <br/> (ii) The other advantage lies in that this scheme is in terms of a harmonically oscillating object which is initially prepared in the most “classical-like” of all quantum states, namely the Schrödinger coherent state, without requiring nonlinearity or coupling with any ancillary quantum system. <br/> (iii) Further, the predicted violation of macrorealism is highly robust to measurement precision, meaning that for our scheme it suffices that the required coarse grained position measurements at various instants determining which spatial region the oscillating object is in are performed with an accuracy that can be less than the standard quantum limit. The central idea underpinning this scheme is a crucial modification we have made of the way any given macrorealist condition is tested. Namely, we consider the dynamical variables that are measured at consecutive times to be different, in contrast to all other studies to date testing the macrorealist conditions. The present talk will explain how this modification gives rise to the above mentioned advantages of our scheme, thereby opening up an earlier unexplored avenue towards enhancing the efficacy of the use of",show,DipankarHome,Prof. Dipankar Home,https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT,3012,Quantum foundation
Prof.,Sibasish,Ghosh,The Institute of Mathematical Sciences,sibasish@imsc.res.in,Accepted,,21,6/2/2023,10:00:00,,Quantum homogenization in Marovian and non-Markovian collisional models,"Collisional models are a category of microscopic framework designed to study dynamics of open quantum systems. The framework involves a system sequentially interacting with a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Such a simple-minded model of system-bath interaction has the potentiality of providing answers to several fundamental questions regarding the system's behavior. In the present talk, we will first discuss about the homogenization process of a system qubit when it sequentially interacts with the individual bath qubits via partial swap operations. We will then discuss about the homogenization process for the system qubit in the non-Markovian collisional model framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial swap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we will show that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states of the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario, where partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer. On the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than its Markovian counter part. Interestingly, a different choice of bath-bath unitary speeds up the homogenization process but loses the universality being dependent on the initial states of the bath units. In our process, we will show a regime of transition of non-Markovian dynamics to Markovian dynamics (and vice-versa).",show,SibashishGhosh,Prof. Sibasish Ghosh,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ksz34fUaXpE,,

However, recently it has been shown [2,3] that this is just a standard quantum limit (SQL).
The Heisenberg limit –– an achievable ultimate limit set by quantum mechanics for the task of producing a beam with the standard properties of a laser beam –– is ℭ = O(μ^4), a quadratic enhancement [2,3]. So far, proposals to demonstrate beyond-SQL scaling of ℭ have been limited to circuit QED, at microwave frequencies (i.e. a maser) [2,4]. Here we present the first optical- frequency laser platform that can surpass the Schawlow-Townes scaling: a super-radiant laser in the bad-cavity limit with feedback-controlled collective pumping. We show that the coherence can exhibit a scaling as large as ℭ ~ μ^8/3, where here μ ≈ N/2, where N is the number of super-radiant atoms. Using atoms with an ultranarrow clock transition (mHz), we predict that a laser linewidth (the reciprocal of the coherence time) below 100 μHz could be attainable. This is more than an order of magnitude below standard super-radiant lasers, where the linewidth is limited to the transition width.

We investigate the usefulness adaptive methods in the framework of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel and observing outputs. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is a fundamental distinction between adaptive and nonadaptive strategies with respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test strategies. The following main results are obtained: (1) We prove that for classical-quantum channels, adaptive and nonadaptive strategies lead to the same error exponents both in the symmetric (Chernoff) and asymmetric (Hoeffding, Stein) settings. (2) The first separation between adaptive and nonadaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for nonadaptive strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking channels. I will also discuss applications of these results and open questions.

Surprisingly, this noise does not affect the effectiveness of the optimal measurement. We show that, for small displacement, a squeezed vacuum probe field is optimal among strategies with same average energy. A squeezer followed by photodetection is the optimal detection strategy that attains the quantum Fisher information, whereas the customarily used homodyne detection becomes useless in the limit of small displacements, due to the same effect that gives Rayleigh's curse in optical superresolution.

The most common examples are the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond or silicon vacancies in silicon-carbide. For all of them, the control technologies that allow one to use them for different applications (e.g. sensing, information processing), must be adapted and optimised for sensitivity (in the case of sensing) or fidelity (in the case of information processing).

the theory by identifying the general structure of state and effect space of 
individual systems as well as specifying their composition rules. This generic

when state and effect cones of individual subsystems are assumed to be quantum.

There is a famous no-go argument against such interactions due to Feynman and Aharonov, and I'll explain how it doesn't apply to theories which are indeterministic. Consistent classical-quantum dynamics exist, and we can derive its most general form. We apply this framework to general relativity, and present a consistent theory of classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. If any system is treated as fundamentally classical, the dynamics necessarily results in decoherence of quantum systems, and a breakdown in predictability in classical phase space. We prove that a trade-off between the rate of decoherence and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general feature of all classical-quantum dynamics. When the trade-off is saturated, the quantum state remains pure conditioned on the classical trajectory and the measurement postulate and Born rule is not needed. Applying the trade-off, we find a relationship between the strength of gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter.

Prof.,Gilad,Gour,University of Calgary,giladgour@gmail.com,Accepted,,32,5/24/2023,9:00:00,,Inevitability of Knowing Less Than Nothing,"A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. In this talk I will introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and I argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. I will then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of my arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.

In such a scenario, the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality only self-tests the nature of the state and local observables. The inability to self-test the post-measurement state precludes the self-testing of the unsharpness parameters. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality is a result of degeneracy-breaking or preserving measurement carried out by one of the spatially separated observer.
In this talk I demonstrate the sequential bipartite Bell test by multiple sequential observers on one side (who perform unsharp measurements, i.e., POVMs) possess the potential to self-test the unsharpness instruments as well as the degeneracy-breaking measurements in a DI way. First, I demonstrate that there exists a trade-off between the maximum sequential quantum violations of the CHSH inequality, which form an optimal pair that enables us to robustly self- test the entangled state, the observables, and the unsharpness parameters in the DI way. Next, I show how one can certify up to what extent the degeneracy has been lifted. In particular, the protocol certifies the upper bound on the number of POVMs used for performing such measurements along with the entangled state and measurement observables. Introduce an elegant sum-of-squares approach enables us to derive the DI optimal quantum violation of Bell inequalities which is crucial in both the works.",show,Alok Kumar Pan,Dr. Alok Kumar Pan,https://youtube.com/watch?v=zd_YulB-is0,714,Quantum foundation & information

It is hoped that laser schemes can be applied to achieve optimal performances by overcoming these problems. This would be a step forward to realizing a practical quantum network.

 We have developed a unified quantum theoretical framework that describes the photon dynamics and the essential mechanisms of photon interactions with f-center molecules in phonon and radiation baths. We will discuss molecular Raman schemes with control by laser pulses.

Concretely, we consider the estimation of matter system parameters such as its transition energy and dipole moment of an individual two-level system. To that end, we compare the performances of different quantum states of quantum light, such as single photons and entangled states of light.

communication tasks","Measurement incompatibility stipulates the existence of quantum measurements that cannot be carried out simultaneously on single systems. We show that measurement incompatibility is necessary for quantum advantage in any classical communication task of arbitrary dimension in the prepare and measure scenario. We formulate a witness to certify incompatibility in a semi-device-independent manner. We next show that for any quantum state and observables of sufficiently small dimensions producing contextuality, there exists a communication task with quantum advantage. In the state independent contextual framework, we demonstrate that the difference between classical and quantum communication complexities increases as the number of inputs grows. Finally, it is shown how to convert each of these communication tasks into a semi-device-independent protocol for quantum key distribution.

When only K<<T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to sqrt(K/N). Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set.

The system and the apparatus evolve in time, and the Born rule for the system to be in various eigenstates of the observable is naturally obtained. In this work, we show that the effect of the drive-induced dissipation in an open quantum system can lead to
the Born rule, even if there is no separate apparatus. The applied drive needs to be much stronger than the system-environment coupling. In this condition, we show that the dynamics of the driven-dissipative system could be reduced to a Milburn-like form using a recently proposed fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation. The irreversible part of the dynamics is caused by drive-induced dissipation. The resulting mixed state is identical to that obtained by using the Born rule [1]. We also discuss the effect of the system-environment coupling and show that the Born rule phase appears as an intermediate quasi-steady-state under suitable driving conditions.

However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down.

The interference dip-width, thus the spectral bandwidth of interfering pair-photons, highly influences the resolution of HOM-based sensors. Typically, the photon-pairs bandwidth, generated through parametric down-conversion, is increased using bulky and expensive ultrafast lasers, limiting their use outside the lab. We show the generation of photon pairs with flexible spectral bandwidth even using single-frequency, continuous-wave diode laser enabling high-precision, real-time sensing. Using a 1-mm-long periodically-poled KTP crystal, we produced degenerate, high-brightness photon pairs with a high spectral bandwidth resulting in a narrow HOM-dip to measure a displacement of 60 nm and vibration amplitude of 205 nm at a frequency of 8 Hz. Finally, we used the HOM interferometer to measure the temperature-dependent refractive index of nonlinear crystals as part of real-time, precision-augmented, in-field quantum sensing applications.

These are optimal protocols for a given average fidelity. Futhermore, we show these protocols have null fidelity deviation and can be intepreted as the perfect quantum teleportation protocol under the action of correlated one-qubit channels on Alice's qubits. In particular, we focused on deterministic protocols, wherein the final Bloch vector length is equal for all measurement outcomes. Within these protocols, there exists one corresponding to the action of uncorrelated channels on Alice's qubits. These channels correspond to depolarization channels, and we have studied their characteristics in detail.

Secondly, we present a protocol for randomness amplification of a specific class of Santha-Vazirani sources for which we show a proof against more general adversaries limited only by the no-signalling principle of relativity.

Physical systems can however be complex in nature and it is not always possible to determine the operator exactly or, even if they are known, to solve the equations they determine.
The complexity of a system e.g one with many body interactions, in general, makes it difficult to determine some or almost all matrix elements (even in absence of disorder). The lack of accuracy acts as a source of randomness for the matrix elements and it can be modeled by a random matrix (with some or all random entries). While the statistical behavior of many body systems in ergodic regime can be well-modeled by the stationary random matrix ensembles, the non-ergodic regime requires consideration of system-dependent random matrix ensembles: those which can take into account the physical constraints on the system e.g. local interactions, dimensionality, symmetry, local conservation laws. For example, the combined effect of nearest neighbor interactions and dimensionality can lead to a sparse random matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a basis of interest, with sparsity and nature of randomness dependent on system-specific details.
The statistical analysis of various many body systems requires, therefore, a thorough probing of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles which is not an easy task. The theoretical analysis is further complicated by the fluctuation of accuracy due to varying system conditions causing multi parametric evolution of the matrix elements. Fortunately we are able to show that, for single-well potentials, it is possible to identify a function of all distribution parameters, seemingly a measure of average uncertainty and therefore referred as the complexity parameter, in terms of which the multi-parametric evolution can be reduced to a single parametric one. As a consequence, the evolution of the statistical properties of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles can be described by a common mathematical formulation where system information enters through the complexity parameter only. This in turn suggests a possible classification of complex systems in an infinite range of universality classes characterized just by the complexity parameter and the nature of global physical constraints e.g. symmetries and conservation laws. The complexity parametric formulation of the statistical properties not only helps in technical simplification (one can apply results available for one complex system to another if they have same complexity parameter and global constraints), it also indicates a web of connection hidden underneath complex systems even in non-ergodic regime, thereby generalising the previously known universality in complex systems in ergodic regime).

The sharpness of the interference that the quanton can produce is constrained by the distinguishability of the two paths. However there exist other kinds of quantum phenomena where interference of two-particle amplitudes results in a two-particle interference, if the particles are indistinguishable. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) effects are two well known examples. We will argue that the HOM and the HBT effects are not two distinct effects, as is usually believed. Instead there is a single phenomenon underlying both, which rests on the indistinguishability of particles, much the same way as single-particle interference rests on the indistinguishability of the two paths the particle takes. In fact, we will show that a duality relation, between particle distinguishability and the visibility of two-particle interference, can be derived. The distinguishability of the two particles, arising from some internal degree of freedom, puts a bound on the sharpness of the two-particle interference they can produce, in a HOM or HBT kind of experiment.",show,TabishQureshi,Prof. Tabish Qureshi,https://youtube.com/watch?v=GCb2Q1X_xMg,1240,Quantum information

","I  discuss the critical formation of exotic quantum droplets and supersolid phases in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (dBEC) by taking into account quantum fluctuation.  An analytical variational ansatz allows us to obtain the phase diagrams of the superfluid and droplet phases. The crossover from the superfluid to the supersolid phase and to single and droplet arrays is probed with particle number and dipolar interaction. The dipolar strength is tuned by rotating the magnetic field with subsequent effects on phase boundaries. Following interaction quenches across the aforementioned phases, we monitor the dynamical formation of supersolid clusters or droplet lattices.

Recent realization of binary dipolar BEC opens new exciting aspects for studying quantum droplets and supersolids in a binary mixture. Relying on the three-dimensional numerical simulations in the extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework, I discuss our findings of the groundstate phase diagrams and characterize different groundstate phases. The emergent phases include both miscible and immiscible single droplets (SD), multiple droplets (MD), supersolid (SS), and superfluid (SF) states. More intriguing mixed groundstates occur for an imbalanced binary mixture, including a combination of SS-SF, SS-MD, and SS-SS phases. Following linear quenches of intra-species scattering lengths across the aforementioned phases, I demonstrate the dynamical formation of supersolid clusters and droplet lattices. I will brief a few possible applications of quantum droplets.

Although in small quantum devices, the noise is assumed to be uncorrelated (Markovian) this assumption fails as the size and complexity increase, and the various system-environment interactions become correlated (non-Markovian).
We present a method of full quantum process tomography that captures non-Markovian noise and a method to detect quantum memory in a non-Markovian process [1]. We call a process Markovian when the environment does not provide a memory that retains correlations across different system-environment interactions. We define two types of non-Markovian processes, depending on the required memory being classical or quantum. We formalise this distinction using the process matrix formalism, through which a process is represented as a multipartite state. Within this formalism, a test for entanglement in the state can be mapped to a test for quantum memory in the process.
We demonstrate the method in a simple toy model, but our methods have been applied experimentally, too, in photonics [2] and superconducting qubits [3].

Such encoded information can only be extracted through joint spatial measurements of the twin beams and not through individual beam measurements, and the temporal quantum correlations are not modified.

The Process Matrix Framework is one such framework that generalises quantum channels to process matrices. This framework has been vastly studied due to the direct applicability of known quantum information tools. Another framework, that chronologically preceded the process matrices is the Causaloid Framework which starts from a more general starting point and can be thought of as incorporating Generalised Probability Theories as well as Indefinite Causality. The Framework has been worked on more recently to be made more accessible. Further a hierarchy within the Causaloid Framework that is distinct from Sorkin's hierarchy, that depends on composition has been introduced. A natural question arises as to how the Process Matrix Formalism and the Causaloid Framework are related and how they can be understood through the introduced hierarchy. We answer this question by showing how the bipartite Process Matrices are a special instance in the Causaloid Framework. This work helps fill a theoretical gap in the literature and by understanding Indefinite Causality from the lens of Generalised Probability Theories helps us make attempts towards an axiomatic approach to Indefinite Causality.

However, sometimes it is not necessary to obtain an error-free outcome. Finding a good expectation value for an observable is often sufficient for many problems of interest in quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, combinatorial optimization, many-body physics etc. A set of methods, collectively called quantum error mitigation, has been studied to extract noise-free expectation values from a noisy device. In this talk, we shall go over a well-known and simple quantum error mitigation method, namely Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). While ZNE is treacherously simple in theory, it is often a challenge to work with it in real scenarios. We shall discuss the best practices for using ZNE and stress upon the importance of partial folding for larger circuits and its implementation method. Moreover, there are some types of noise for which ZNE does not provide any improvement - thus lowering its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We show that ZNE, when combined with measurement error mitigation and twirling, can overcome these shortcomings. We conclude by giving some insight into the choice of extrapolator and their effectiveness for this method.

Brain inspired Neuromorphic computing architecture integrated with in-memory computing capability could instigate unprecedented breakthroughs in AI technology.

However, the standard approach for implementing LCU requires a large number of ancilla qubits, as well as the ability to implement sophisticated controlled operations, leading to a large circuit depth. Thus, this broadly applicable quantum algorithmic paradigm is only useful for fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are decades away. In this talk, I will describe a randomized quantum algorithm that can implement any LCU by repeatedly sampling from a short-depth quantum circuit, and using only a single ancilla qubit. This algorithm can be run using early fault-tolerant quantum computers -- quantum devices that are expected to be available immediately after the current Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum stage, characterized by short circuit-depth and a limited number of logical qubits. I will apply this method to problems of wide applicability: estimation of the expectation value of any observable with respect to the ground states of Hamiltonians and the solution of quantum linear systems. This leads to novel quantum algorithms for these problems, which are less resource-demanding than the prior art, while remarkably, still retaining a provable quantum advantage. I will also briefly explore: (i) the possibility of implementing any LCU without any ancilla qubits and (ii) other intermediate-term quantum hardware possibilities that go beyond the circuit model and implement LCU using hybrid qubit-qumode systems. Overall, these techniques can be applied to develop quantum algorithms for several problems, with performance guarantees, tailored to intermediate-term quantum computers.",show,Shantanav Chakraborty,Dr. Shantanav Chakraborty,https://youtube.com/watch?v=6tNXt_ULSto,,

In quantum many-body systems, a certain kind of chaotic-non-chaotic transitions, dubbed ‘measurement-induced phase transitions’ (MIPT), have led to a new paradigm for dynamical phase transitions in recent years. On the other hand, prominent examples of transition in chaos in classical dynamical systems are the stochastic synchronization transitions (ST). In this case, classical trajectories starting from different initial conditions synchronize when subjected to sufficiently strong common random stochastic noise. In this talk, I will establish a direct link between MIPT and ST by considering models of interacting quantum particles, whose positions are measured continuously, albeit weakly. In the semiclassical limit, the dynamics of the system is described by a stochastic Langevin equation where the noise and the dissipation terms are both controlled by the small quantum parameter and measurement strength.

It enables the generation of elementary entanglement with clients and facilitates entanglement swapping to establish end-to-end entanglement between clients. The fidelity threshold for end-to-end entanglement depends on clients' quality of service requirements. This talk describes a discrete time model for quantum switches that probabilistically generate maximally entangled qubit pairs (Bell pairs) with clients. We show the importance of entanglement distillation, in countering the effects of aging and decoherence. Using a simple switch scenario with two clients and modeling fidelity of elementary links as exponential decay and a probabilistic two-to-one distillation protocol, we utilize the Markov Decision Processes framework to identify the optimal action policy (wait, distill, or swap) for maximizing throughput. By comparing switch performance with and without distillation, we highlight potential enhancements in average throughput, fidelity, and jitter of end-to-end entanglement links based on their fidelity thresholds.",hide,NA,Mr. Nitish Kumar Chandra,,,

Researchers are keen to explore the prospect of quantum circuit implementation in terms of supervised learning, resource utilization, and energy‐efficientreversible computing. In this study, the authors propose an application of quantum circuit in Siamese architecture and explored its efficiency in the field of exudate‐affectedretinal image patch retrieval.Quantum computing applied within Siamese network architecture may be effective for image patch characteristic comparison and retrieval work.Although there is a restriction of managing high‐dimensional inner product space, the circuit with a limited number of qubits represents exudate‐affected retinal image patches and retrieves similar patches from the patch database. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)is implemented using a quantum machine learning library on Google Cirq framework.PQC model is composed of classical pre/post‐processing and parameterized quantum circuit. System efficiency is evaluated with the most widely used retrieval evaluation metrics: mean average precision(MAP) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). The system achieved an encouraging and  promising result of 98.1336% MAP and 100% MRR. Image pixels are implicitly con-verted to rectangular grid qubits in this experiment.

The answer is positive due to various quantum protocols like teleportation, dense coding, quantum cryptography, etc. In the current century, the entanglement of indistinguishable particles and their similarity with, as well as difference from that of distinguishable ones, is becoming the major area of research. Various physical systems like Bose-Einstein condensate, quantum dots, ultra-cold atomic gases, etc., support the existence of entanglement of indistinguishable particles which find applications in tasks like teleportation, and entanglement swapping, metrology, coherence, steering, etc.

We prove that if quantum particles (either distinguishable or indistinguishable) can simultaneously produce and perform hyper-hybrid entangled state and unit fidelity quantum teleportation respectively, then cloning any arbitrary quantum state is possible. This theorem results in two no-go theorems: 
(1) hyper-hybrid entangled state is not possible for distinguishable particles and 
(2) unit fidelity quantum teleportation is not possible for indistinguishable particles. 
These theorems establish that there exists some quantum correlation or application unique to indistinguishable particles only and yet some unique to distinguishable particles only, giving separation between the two domains.

We establish a generalized degree of freedom trace-out rule that covers single or multiple degrees of freedom scenarios for both distinguishable and indistinguishable systems. Further, using the generalized degree of freedom trace-out rule, we show that, for two indistinguishable particles each having more than one degree of freedom, the monogamy of entanglement can be violated maximally using the measures that are monogamous for distinguishable particles. This results in the following theorem “In qubit systems, indistinguishability is a necessary criterion for maximum violation of monogamy of entanglement by the same measures that are monogamous for distinguishable particles”.

field of quantum information and computation. A measure of bipartite entanglement is
proposed here, named entanglement coherence, which is essentially the normalized
coherence of the entangled state in its Schmidt basis. Its value is 1 for maximally entangled
states and 0 for separable states, irrespective of the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. So,
a maximally entangled state is also the one which is maximally coherent in its Schmidt basis.
Quantum entanglement and quantum coherence are thus intimately connected.
Additionally, we will see that entanglement coherence is closely connected to the Wigner-
Yanase skew information of the reduced density operator of one of the subsystems in an
interesting way. We will also learn how this entanglement coherence is related to the
robustness of entanglement and unified entropy.

Quantum key distribution (QKD) facilitates the secure distribution of a key by employing quantum resources such as superposition and entanglement. In this talk, we primarily focus on prepare-and-measure QKD protocols. We start with the BB84 protocol proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984 and discuss how non-orthogonality among the states allows for the detection of an eavesdropper, if any. Thereafter, we discuss the idea of semi-QKD (SQKD) proposed by Boyer in 2007. SQKD allows for the secure distribution of a key between a quantum and a classical participant. (A quantum participant can prepare a state and measure it in any basis whereas a classical participant can prepare a state and perform a measurement only in the computational basis.). So, SQKD reduces the burden on the availability of quantum resources and is hence suitable in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. As the next step, we show that by employing qubits encoded in high-dimensional spaces and suitably designed key generation rules, the key generation rate of QKD and SQKD protocols can be increased and that too in an experiment-friendly manner.",hide,NA,Ms. Rajni Bala,,,

We also propose how to measure the mutual predictability experimentally from the intensity patterns of the interferometric set-up without having to resort to local measurements of mutually unbiased bases. Furthermore, we show that the entanglement witness operator can be measured in a interference setup and the phase shift is sensitive to the separable or entangled nature of the state.

We propose that indefinite causal structure arising due to quantum superposition of different space-time geometries can be used as an independent universal resource for local implementation of any quantum operation on spatially distributed quantum systems. Consequently, all such quantum tasks that are not accomplishable by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) only also become locally accomplishable. We show that exploiting indefinite causal structure as the sole resource, it is possible to perfectly teleport the state of one agent's subsystem to the other distant laboratory in such a way that the agent at the distant laboratory can have access to the whole initially shared state in his or her laboratory and can perform any global quantum operation on the joint state locally. We further find that, after the teleportation process, the resource -- indefinite causal structure of the space-time does not get consumed. Hence, after implementing the desired quantum operation the state of the first agent's subsystem can be teleported back to its previous laboratory using the same resource. We show that this two-way teleportation is not always necessary for locally executing all nonlocal quantum tasks that are not realisable by LOCC only. Without invoking any kind of teleportation, we present a protocol for perfect local discrimination of the set of four Bell states that exploits indefinite causal structure as the sole resource.

Genuine multiparty entanglement serves as a crucial checkpoint in the realisation of stabiliser states. In the age of noisy intermediate scale quantum devices, which are vulnerable to errors caused by the interference of the environment, characterising such noisy multiparty quantum states utilising genuine multiparty entanglement is important and still a difficult task. In this work, we derive lower bounds on genuine multiparty entanglement localized over a selected multiparty subsystem of multi-qubit stabiliser states in the noiseless and noisy scenario. By exploiting the connection between stabiliser states and graph states in the absence of noise, we propose the protocol for localization in any given graph state while demonstrating that the graph operations necessary for the calculation have a polynomial scaling with the system size. As examples, we compute the localised genuine multiparty entanglement over the subsystems of large linear, ladder, and square structured networks. Further we extend the calculations for graph states subjected to single-qubit Markovian or non-Markovian Pauli noise on all qubits to show the usefulness of the protocol in detecting the critical noise strengths on which the localized states are no more genuinely multiparty entangled. In order to show the applicability on stabilizer states, we consider toric code defined on a square lattice under decoherence, and compute a lower bound of localizable genuine multiparty entanglement over a non-trivial loop of the code. We demonstrate the presence of the critical noise strength in this instance and explain some of its intriguing characteristics.",hide,NA,Mr. Harikrishnan K J ,,,

We fundamentally modify these paradigms by introducing, theoretically and experimentally, the concept of controlling the state of a spin-bath by selective measurements of a probe-spin (a qubit). We show that at intervals corresponding to the anti-Zeno regime of the system-bath exchange, a sequence of selective probe-measurements has strongly correlated outcomes. These correlations can dramatically enhance the bath-state purity leading to a low-entropy steady state of the bath. The experiment was performed using a repeatedly probed defect center dephased by a nuclear spin bath in a low-temperature diamond. We find that the purified bath state persists long after the measurements are completed. The purified spin baths thus obtained, can be used as long-lived quantum memories or as quantum-enhanced sensors.",hide,NA, Arnab Chakraborty,,,

Here, we present a geometric decomposition of geodesics and NPCs in higher-dimensional state space, which allows an understanding of the intrinsic symmetries of these curves. We use Majorana star representation to decompose a geodesic in the n-dimensional Hilbert space to n−1 curves on the Bloch sphere and show that all the n−1 curves are circular segments with specific properties that are determined by the inner product of the end states connected by the given geodesic.

Identifying and constructing the pretty good measurement for the class of bosonic Gaussian states is of immediate practical relevance in quantum information processing tasks. Holevo recently showed that the pretty good measurement of a Gaussian ensemble in a multimode bosonic system is a Gaussian measurement that attains the accessible information of the ensemble [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 66(9):5634–564, 2020]. In this paper, we provide an alternate proof of Gaussianity of the pretty good measurement for a Gaussian ensemble of multimode bosonic states, with a focus on providing an explicit and efficiently computable Gaussian description of the measurement. We also compute an explicit form of the mean square error of the pretty good measurement, which is relevant when using it for parameter estimation. Associated with the pretty good measurement is a quantum instrument, called the pretty good instrument. We prove that both the post-measurement state and the expected output state of the pretty good instrument are faithful Gaussian states if the input state is a faithful Gaussian state whose covariance matrix satisfies a certain condition. In this case, we also compute an explicit Gaussian description of the post-measurement and the expected output states.

considered in infinite limit scenario. For instance, state transformations in both the cases are
governed by some no-go principles. While in thermodynamics they always obey the 2
nd law, in entanglement theory local manipulations and classical communications cannot increase
entanglement. Although there is no apparent connection between these no-go’s, existence of
peculiar quantum correlations established a deep-rooted link between these two theories. During
recent past, significant efforts have been devoted in investigating the connection of quantum
correlations with the thermodynamic quantity, in particular the extractable work. The work
extraction from a quantum system can be obtained in two different ways -- (i) first, in the presence
of bath (analogous to the Isothermal process) & (ii) secondly, from the system itself (analogous to
the Adiabatic process). While the first kind of work extraction relates to the information theoretic
quantity, i.e., von Neuman entropy, the second kind of work is depended on energy of the system.
In this talk I will discuss the second aspect of work extraction which is also known as ergotropy.
In such a case the entropy of the system does not change as the state is evolved under unitary
operations. Remarkably, quantum correlations play a crucial role in ergotropic work extraction. In
the emerging era of quantum technology, identification, characterization, and quantification of
entanglement are of extreme practical relevance. In our work we propose some thermodynamic
quantities that capture signatures of entanglement for bipartite as well as for multipartite systems.
As the proposed thermodynamic measures are solely energy dependent it welcomes experimental
implementation. Furthermore, the work function of a quantum battery is greatly relied on
ergotropy. Thus, it constitutes a promising research endeavor to study the connections among

Recently we proposed a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that represents the location information of an image with a superposition of mutually orthogonal vectors of an arbitrary basis and stores the pixel information in the phases of the corresponding basis vectors without any extra qubit cost.

Note that the standard Bell test cannot self-test the post-measurement states and consequently cannot self-test unsharp instrument. The sequential Bell test possess the potential to self-test an unsharp instrument. We demonstrate that there exists a trade-off between the maximum sequential quantum violations of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt inequality, and they form an optimal pair that enables the DI self-testing of the entangled state, the observables, and the unsharpness parameter. Further, we extend our study to the case of elegant Bell inequality and we argue that it has two classical bounds—the local bound and the non-trivial preparation non-contextual bound, lower than the local bound. Based on the sharing of preparation contextuality by three independent sequential observers, we demonstrate the DI self-testing of two unsharpness parameters.
