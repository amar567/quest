This is India\u2019s first satellite based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) project which aims to develop indigenous technologies for satellite based QKD towards a quantum secure future for India. Here, we will report on several milestones achieved by the QuEST project. The first involves the development of a novel, indigenous QKD simulation toolkit qkdSim [1], as well as the establishment of a prepare and measure based QKD experiment. The simulation results match well with experiment; a representative key rate and the quantum bit error rate from experiment is 51\u00b10.5 kbit/sec and 4.79%\u00b10.01% respectively, wherein the simulation yields 52.83\u00b10.36 kbit/sec and 4.79%\u00b10.01%, respectively[2]. With this, we establish a prepare and measure based QKD protocol in the lab with an indigenous novel simulation toolkit, both very important milestones towards our quest for satellite based QKD in India. We will then discuss our demonstration of free space entanglement based quantum communication between two buildings at RRI through an atmospheric channel, the first such demonstration in India, first performed in February 2021. We will then discuss our recent work on passive feedback based polarisation scrambling mitigation, a crucial requirement for long haul quantum communications [3]. One of the major challenges in long distance quantum communications is the polarization degree of freedom of single-photons getting affected while transmission through optical fibres, or atmospheric turbulence. Conventionally, an active feedback-based mechanism is employed to achieve real-time polarization tracking. In this work, we propose an alternative, less resource intensive, passive feedback based approach. As a proof-of- principle demonstration, we implement an in-lab BBM92 protocol to exemplify the performance of our technique.\nWe will end with our broad vision for the future in terms of a global quantum communication network.\n[1] An experimenter\u2019s toolkit for simulating Quantum Key Distribution protocol implementations, R.\nChatterjee, S.

QKD is one of the most ubiquitous applications of quantum mechanics in modern times. Though QKD provides unconditional security, its practical implementation deviates from the ideal one, affecting the security of key. In this talk, we will discuss the techniques to improve the key rates for BB84 and BBM92 QKD protocol and methods to characterize implementation loopholes that make it vulnerable against the side channel attacks. For increasing the key rate using weak coherent laser pulses, we introduce a novel quantum key distribution protocol, called coincidence detection quantum key distribution protocol (CD Protocol). We show that the Poissonian nature of weak coherent pulses instead of posing a security risk can be used to achieve a secure key rate higher than the standard GLLP and decoy state QKD protocols. Prepare and measure protocols such as BB84 consider the satellite as a trusted device, which is fraught with danger looking at the current trend for satellite based optical communication.Therefore, entanglement-based QKD (EB QKD) protocols must be preferred since, along with overcoming the distance limitation, one can take the satellite as an untrusted device. The most well-known EB QKD protocol is the E91 protocol, but the achieved key rate is less as maximum of the bits are sacrificed for measuring Bell parameter. This key rate can be increased without compromising the security provided by EB QKD, if one uses the BBM92 protocol with a pre-characterized relation between S and QBER. Thus, an estimate of QBER provides a simultaneous measurement of entanglement without sacrificing the bits used in proving the Bell\u2019s inequality violation.

However, many experiments admit effective descriptions in terms of other state spaces, such as classical probability distributions or quantum systems with superselection rules. Here, we ask which probabilistic theories could reasonably be found as effective descriptions of physical systems if nature is fundamentally quantum. To this end, we employ a generalized version of noncontextuality: processes that are statistically indistinguishable in an effective theory should not require explanation by multiple distinguishable processes in a more fundamental theory. We formulate this principle in terms of embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude of fundamental results on the exact and approximate embedding of theories (in particular into quantum theory). We show how results on Bell inequalities can be used for the robust certification of this generalized notion of contextuality. From this, we propose an experimental test of quantum theory by probing single physical systems without assuming access to a tomographically complete set of procedures, arguably avoiding a significant loophole of earlier approaches.\n\nBased on joint work with Andrew J.

The goal is to expand as much possible the macroscopic domain of such tests. Broadly speaking, these tests probe the quantum-classical boundary in terms of superposition of macroscopically distinct states (Schr\u00f6dinger cat-type states), a line of study which can even have practical applications like for quantum sensing, apart from providing empirical constraints on various modifications of quantum dynamical evolution in the macrolimit that have been proposed towards addressing the quantum measurement problem. Against this backdrop, our work discussed in the present talk formulates a testable example in which an inherent quantumness of a massive harmonically oscillating object can be demonstrated in a way which has the following three key advantages:<br/> (i) The magnitude of quantumness evidenced through the predicted violation of a suitable macrorealist condition (like the Leggett-Garg inequality, or the no-signalling in time condition) is independent of mass. Such violation is also predicted to be independent of the other relevant experimental parameters like the oscillation frequency and momentum, dependent only on the choice of instants of the measurements. Thus, the implied operational flexibility would greatly facilitate in scaling up the test of macrorealism and quantumness, all the way to considerably large masses. <br/> (ii) The other advantage lies in that this scheme is in terms of a harmonically oscillating object which is initially prepared in the most \u201cclassical-like\u201d of all quantum states, namely the Schr\u00f6dinger coherent state, without requiring nonlinearity or coupling with any ancillary quantum system. <br/> (iii) Further, the predicted violation of macrorealism is highly robust to measurement precision, meaning that for our scheme it suffices that the required coarse grained position measurements at various instants determining which spatial region the oscillating object is in are performed with an accuracy that can be less than the standard quantum limit. The central idea underpinning this scheme is a crucial modification we have made of the way any given macrorealist condition is tested. Namely, we consider the dynamical variables that are measured at consecutive times to be different, in contrast to all other studies to date testing the macrorealist conditions.

The framework involves a system sequentially interacting with a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Such a simple-minded model of system-bath interaction has the potentiality of providing answers to several fundamental questions regarding the system's behavior. In the present talk, we will first discuss about the homogenization process of a system qubit when it sequentially interacts with the individual bath qubits via partial swap operations. We will then discuss about the homogenization process for the system qubit in the non-Markovian collisional model framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial swap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we will show that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states of the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario, where partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer. On the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than its Markovian counter part.

So far, proposals to demonstrate beyond-SQL scaling of \u212d have been limited to circuit QED, at microwave frequencies (i.e. a maser) [2,4]. Here we present the first optical- frequency laser platform that can surpass the Schawlow-Townes scaling: a super-radiant laser in the bad-cavity limit with feedback-controlled collective pumping. We show that the coherence can exhibit a scaling as large as \u212d ~ \u03bc^8/3, where here \u03bc \u2248 N/2, where N is the number of super-radiant atoms.

We investigate the usefulness adaptive methods in the framework of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel and observing outputs. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is a fundamental distinction between adaptive and nonadaptive strategies with respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test strategies. The following main results are obtained: (1) We prove that for classical-quantum channels, adaptive and nonadaptive strategies lead to the same error exponents both in the symmetric (Chernoff) and asymmetric (Hoeffding, Stein) settings. (2) The first separation between adaptive and nonadaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for nonadaptive strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking channels.

There is a famous no-go argument against such interactions due to Feynman and Aharonov, and I'll explain how it doesn't apply to theories which are indeterministic. Consistent classical-quantum dynamics exist, and we can derive its most general form. We apply this framework to general relativity, and present a consistent theory of classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. If any system is treated as fundamentally classical, the dynamics necessarily results in decoherence of quantum systems, and a breakdown in predictability in classical phase space. We prove that a trade-off between the rate of decoherence and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general feature of all classical-quantum dynamics. When the trade-off is saturated, the quantum state remains pure conditioned on the classical trajectory and the measurement postulate and Born rule is not needed. Applying the trade-off, we find a relationship between the strength of gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter.\n\nBased on joint work with Carlo Sparaciari, Barbara \u0160oda & Zachary Weller-Davies\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03116\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01982\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07283", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "JonathanOppenheim", "Name": "Prof. Jonathan Oppenheim", "Link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=BCRvXNwRVwY", "Citations": "9720", "Topic": "Quantum information"}, {"": "Prof.", "First Name": "Gilad", "Surename": "Gour", "Affiliation": "University of Calgary", "Primary email": "giladgour@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "id": "32", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/24/2023", "Time ( IST )": "9:00:00", "end": "", "Title": "Inevitability of Knowing Less Than Nothing", "Abstract": "A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. In this talk I will introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and I argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. I will then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of my arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.

In such a scenario, the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality only self-tests the nature of the state and local observables. The inability to self-test the post-measurement state precludes the self-testing of the unsharpness parameters. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality is a result of degeneracy-breaking or preserving measurement carried out by one of the spatially separated observer.\nIn this talk I demonstrate the sequential bipartite Bell test by multiple sequential observers on one side (who perform unsharp measurements, i.e., POVMs) possess the potential to self-test the unsharpness instruments as well as the degeneracy-breaking measurements in a DI way.

Next, I show how one can certify up to what extent the degeneracy has been lifted.

We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as sqrt(T/N). When only K<<T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to sqrt(K/N). Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set.

The system and the apparatus evolve in time, and the Born rule for the system to be in various eigenstates of the observable is naturally obtained. In this work, we show that the effect of the drive-induced dissipation in an open quantum system can lead to\nthe Born rule, even if there is no separate apparatus. The applied drive needs to be much stronger than the system-environment coupling. In this condition, we show that the dynamics of the driven-dissipative system could be reduced to a Milburn-like form using a recently proposed fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation. The irreversible part of the dynamics is caused by drive-induced dissipation. The resulting mixed state is identical to that obtained by using the Born rule [1]. We also discuss the effect of the system-environment coupling and show that the Born rule phase appears as an intermediate quasi-steady-state under suitable driving conditions.\n[1] N Chanda, R Bhattacharyya, Emergence of the Born rule in strongly-driven dissipative systems,\nPhysical Review, A 104 (2), 022436 (2021)", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "Rangeet", "Name": "Prof. Rangeet Bhattacharyya", "Link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=8PuqE8oJst4", "Citations": "", "Topic": ""}, {"": "Prof.", "First Name": "Bhanu", "Surename": "Das", "Affiliation": "TCG Crest", "Primary email": "Bhanu.das@tcgcrest.org", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "id": "51", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/25/2023", "Time ( IST )": "10:00:00", "end": "", "Title": "Computation of Relativistic and Correlation Effects in Atomic Systems Using Quantum Annealing", "Abstract": "The fine structure splitting (FSS) in atomic systems has its origins in relativistic effects, and it it is influenced by electron correlation.

However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down.

We show the generation of photon pairs with flexible spectral bandwidth even using single-frequency, continuous-wave diode laser enabling high-precision, real-time sensing. Using a 1-mm-long periodically-poled KTP crystal, we produced degenerate, high-brightness photon pairs with a high spectral bandwidth resulting in a narrow HOM-dip to measure a displacement of 60 nm and vibration amplitude of 205 nm at a frequency of 8 Hz.

Physical systems can however be complex in nature and it is not always possible to determine the operator exactly or, even if they are known, to solve the equations they determine.\nThe complexity of a system e.g one with many body interactions, in general, makes it difficult to determine some or almost all matrix elements (even in absence of disorder). The lack of accuracy acts as a source of randomness for the matrix elements and it can be modeled by a random matrix (with some or all random entries). While the statistical behavior of many body systems in ergodic regime can be well-modeled by the stationary random matrix ensembles, the non-ergodic regime requires consideration of system-dependent random matrix ensembles: those which can take into account the physical constraints on the system e.g. local interactions, dimensionality, symmetry, local conservation laws. For example, the combined effect of nearest neighbor interactions and dimensionality can lead to a sparse random matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a basis of interest, with sparsity and nature of randomness dependent on system-specific details.\nThe statistical analysis of various many body systems requires, therefore, a thorough probing of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles which is not an easy task. The theoretical analysis is further complicated by the fluctuation of accuracy due to varying system conditions causing multi parametric evolution of the matrix elements. Fortunately we are able to show that, for single-well potentials, it is possible to identify a function of all distribution parameters, seemingly a measure of average uncertainty and therefore referred as the complexity parameter, in terms of which the multi-parametric evolution can be reduced to a single parametric one. As a consequence, the evolution of the statistical properties of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles can be described by a common mathematical formulation where system information enters through the complexity parameter only. This in turn suggests a possible classification of complex systems in an infinite range of universality classes characterized just by the complexity parameter and the nature of global physical constraints e.g. symmetries and conservation laws. The complexity parametric formulation of the statistical properties not only helps in technical simplification (one can apply results available for one complex system to another if they have same complexity parameter and global constraints), it also indicates a web of connection hidden underneath complex systems even in non-ergodic regime, thereby generalising the previously known universality in complex systems in ergodic regime).\n.\nReferences\n\nP.

However there exist other kinds of quantum phenomena where interference of two-particle amplitudes results in a two-particle interference, if the particles are indistinguishable. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) effects are two well known examples. We will argue that the HOM and the HBT effects are not two distinct effects, as is usually believed. Instead there is a single phenomenon underlying both, which rests on the indistinguishability of particles, much the same way as single-particle interference rests on the indistinguishability of the two paths the particle takes. In fact, we will show that a duality relation, between particle distinguishability and the visibility of two-particle interference, can be derived.

The emergent phases include both miscible and immiscible single droplets (SD), multiple droplets (MD), supersolid (SS), and superfluid (SF) states. More intriguing mixed groundstates occur for an imbalanced binary mixture, including a combination of SS-SF, SS-MD, and SS-SS phases.

We call a process Markovian when the environment does not provide a memory that retains correlations across different system-environment interactions. We define two types of non-Markovian processes, depending on the required memory being classical or quantum.

The Process Matrix Framework is one such framework that generalises quantum channels to process matrices. This framework has been vastly studied due to the direct applicability of known quantum information tools. Another framework, that chronologically preceded the process matrices is the Causaloid Framework which starts from a more general starting point and can be thought of as incorporating Generalised Probability Theories as well as Indefinite Causality. The Framework has been worked on more recently to be made more accessible. Further a hierarchy within the Causaloid Framework that is distinct from Sorkin's hierarchy, that depends on composition has been introduced. A natural question arises as to how the Process Matrix Formalism and the Causaloid Framework are related and how they can be understood through the introduced hierarchy. We answer this question by showing how the bipartite Process Matrices are a special instance in the Causaloid Framework.

In this talk, we shall go over a well-known and simple quantum error mitigation method, namely Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). While ZNE is treacherously simple in theory, it is often a challenge to work with it in real scenarios. We shall discuss the best practices for using ZNE and stress upon the importance of partial folding for larger circuits and its implementation method. Moreover, there are some types of noise for which ZNE does not provide any improvement - thus lowering its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We show that ZNE, when combined with measurement error mitigation and twirling, can overcome these shortcomings. We conclude by giving some insight into the choice of extrapolator and their effectiveness for this method.\n\nReference: R. Majumdar, P. Rivero, D. Wang.

Brain inspired Neuromorphic computing architecture integrated with in-memory computing capability could instigate unprecedented breakthroughs in AI technology. Although there has been progress in Neuromorphic computing, however, engineering the material aspect for its architecture remains a challenge. In this regard, the two- dimensional (2D) layered materials, consisting of atomically-thin layers, possess a plethora of exotic properties and have emerged as the leading contenders for the next generation of electronic devices. Specific attention has been given to the layered transition metal di- chalcogenides (TMDCs), has created numerous prospects for developing low-power electronics, cutting-edge memory device arrays and smart computing architectures with desirable miniaturization. In this talk I will discuss two approaches for achieving Neuromorphic computing with monolayer TMDCs mem-transistors; optoelectronic and thermal driven ionotronic approach. Two-dimensional TMDC transistors demonstrating optoelectronic artificial synapse and reconfigurable logic operation are fabricated. The persistent photoconductivity of these devices are used to achieve the long- short term synaptic plasticity behaviour. Furthermore, Pavlov\u2019s classical conditioning is demonstrated by using the broadband sensitivity of the devices. More importantly, reconfigurable Boolean logic gate operations are demonstrated within the same device. We also demonstrate a novel mem- transistor device using monolayer TMDCs as channel that offers multi-bit high density storage states and can perform key synaptic operations above room temperature. This novel integration of memory, synaptic behaviour, and processing within a single monolayer TMDC device put forth a new horizon for the Non-Von-Neuman type in-memory computing architecture for advanced AI applications at room temperature and beyond.", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "SatyaprakashSahoo", "Name": "Prof. Satyaprakash Sahoo", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp-3dewQb8w", "Citations": "70", "Topic": "Brain-inspired Neuromrophic Computing and Memory Applications based on Novel Metal Oxide and 2D Chalcogenides"}, {"": "Dr.", "First Name": "Shantanav", "Surename": "Chakraborty", "Affiliation": "IIIT Hyd", "Primary email": "shchakra@iiit.ac.in", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "id": "112", "Date (double click to pick)": "6/1/2023", "Time ( IST )": "12:00:00", "end": "", "Title": "Implementing Linear Combination of Unitaries on Intermediate-term Quantum Computers", "Abstract": "Abstract: Over the years, the framework of Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) has been extremely useful for designing optimal quantum algorithms for a wide variety of problems. However, the standard approach for implementing LCU requires a large number of ancilla qubits, as well as the ability to implement sophisticated controlled operations, leading to a large circuit depth. Thus, this broadly applicable quantum algorithmic paradigm is only useful for fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are decades away. In this talk, I will describe a randomized quantum algorithm that can implement any LCU by repeatedly sampling from a short-depth quantum circuit, and using only a single ancilla qubit. This algorithm can be run using early fault-tolerant quantum computers -- quantum devices that are expected to be available immediately after the current Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum stage, characterized by short circuit-depth and a limited number of logical qubits. I will apply this method to problems of wide applicability: estimation of the expectation value of any observable with respect to the ground states of Hamiltonians and the solution of quantum linear systems. This leads to novel quantum algorithms for these problems, which are less resource-demanding than the prior art, while remarkably, still retaining a provable quantum advantage. I will also briefly explore: (i) the possibility of implementing any LCU without any ancilla qubits and (ii) other intermediate-term quantum hardware possibilities that go beyond the circuit model and implement LCU using hybrid qubit-qumode systems. Overall, these techniques can be applied to develop quantum algorithms for several problems, with performance guarantees, tailored to intermediate-term quantum computers.", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "Shantanav Chakraborty", "Name": "Dr. Shantanav Chakraborty", "Link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=6tNXt_ULSto", "Citations": "", "Topic": ""}, {"": "Dr.", "First Name": "Kamanasish ", "Surename": "Debnath", "Affiliation": "\u00d8rsted", "Primary email": "kamanasish.debnath@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "id": "113", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/22/2023", "Time ( IST )": "10:00:00", "end": "", "Title": "Dynamics of atomic ensembles coupled to an optical cavity", "Abstract": "The talk will focus on dynamics of atomic ensembles coupled to an optical cavity.

The thermodynamics no longer remains a concept based on ensemble average and the quantum properties of individual particles come to the forefront. In this talk, we will first redefine the various thermodynamic parameters in the quantum domain and then focus toward implementation of quantum thermal machines (QTM). We will discuss in detail about the implementation of different stages of a QTM, particularly an Otto engine, which interacts with two baths sequentially. It is often assumed that these baths can be switched on or off in a controlled manner which could be very challenging experimentally as the heat bath is always on at the quantum level.

On the other hand, prominent examples of transition in chaos in classical dynamical systems are the stochastic synchronization transitions (ST). In this case, classical trajectories starting from different initial conditions synchronize when subjected to sufficiently strong common random stochastic noise. In this talk, I will establish a direct link between MIPT and ST by considering models of interacting quantum particles, whose positions are measured continuously, albeit weakly. In the semiclassical limit, the dynamics of the system is described by a stochastic Langevin equation where the noise and the dissipation terms are both controlled by the small quantum parameter and measurement strength.

This talk describes a discrete time model for quantum switches that probabilistically generate maximally entangled qubit pairs (Bell pairs) with clients. We show the importance of entanglement distillation, in countering the effects of aging and decoherence. Using a simple switch scenario with two clients and modeling fidelity of elementary links as exponential decay and a probabilistic two-to-one distillation protocol, we utilize the Markov Decision Processes framework to identify the optimal action policy (wait, distill, or swap) for maximizing throughput.

The answer is positive due to various quantum protocols like teleportation, dense coding, quantum cryptography, etc. In the current century, the entanglement of indistinguishable particles and their similarity with, as well as difference from that of distinguishable ones, is becoming the major area of research. Various physical systems like Bose-Einstein condensate, quantum dots, ultra-cold atomic gases, etc., support the existence of entanglement of indistinguishable particles which find applications in tasks like teleportation, and entanglement swapping, metrology, coherence, steering, etc.\n\nWe prove that if quantum particles (either distinguishable or indistinguishable) can simultaneously produce and perform hyper-hybrid entangled state and unit fidelity quantum teleportation respectively, then cloning any arbitrary quantum state is possible. This theorem results in two no-go theorems: \n(1) hyper-hybrid entangled state is not possible for distinguishable particles and \n(2) unit fidelity quantum teleportation is not possible for indistinguishable particles. \nThese theorems establish that there exists some quantum correlation or application unique to indistinguishable particles only and yet some unique to distinguishable particles only, giving separation between the two domains.\n\nWe establish a generalized degree of freedom trace-out rule that covers single or multiple degrees of freedom scenarios for both distinguishable and indistinguishable systems. Further, using the generalized degree of freedom trace-out rule, we show that, for two indistinguishable particles each having more than one degree of freedom, the monogamy of entanglement can be violated maximally using the measures that are monogamous for distinguishable particles.

We propose that indefinite causal structure arising due to quantum superposition of different space-time geometries can be used as an independent universal resource for local implementation of any quantum operation on spatially distributed quantum systems. Consequently, all such quantum tasks that are not accomplishable by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) only also become locally accomplishable. We show that exploiting indefinite causal structure as the sole resource, it is possible to perfectly teleport the state of one agent's subsystem to the other distant laboratory in such a way that the agent at the distant laboratory can have access to the whole initially shared state in his or her laboratory and can perform any global quantum operation on the joint state locally. We further find that, after the teleportation process, the resource -- indefinite causal structure of the space-time does not get consumed. Hence, after implementing the desired quantum operation the state of the first agent's subsystem can be teleported back to its previous laboratory using the same resource.

In the age of noisy intermediate scale quantum devices, which are vulnerable to errors caused by the interference of the environment, characterising such noisy multiparty quantum states utilising genuine multiparty entanglement is important and still a difficult task. In this work, we derive lower bounds on genuine multiparty entanglement localized over a selected multiparty subsystem of multi-qubit stabiliser states in the noiseless and noisy scenario. By exploiting the connection between stabiliser states and graph states in the absence of noise, we propose the protocol for localization in any given graph state while demonstrating that the graph operations necessary for the calculation have a polynomial scaling with the system size.

Further we extend the calculations for graph states subjected to single-qubit Markovian or non-Markovian Pauli noise on all qubits to show the usefulness of the protocol in detecting the critical noise strengths on which the localized states are no more genuinely multiparty entangled. In order to show the applicability on stabilizer states, we consider toric code defined on a square lattice under decoherence, and compute a lower bound of localizable genuine multiparty entanglement over a non-trivial loop of the code.

These systems are weakly coupled to the environment and reach prethermal states on a timescale much shorter than the timescale for thermalization. In this presentation, using a fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation (FRQME), we will describe the emergence of a prethermal plateau in these systems. In addition to the system-environment coupling, FRQME successfully captures the dissipative effect from the various local interactions in the system that leads to a cascaded journey of the system to a final steady state. The cascade involves a set of prethermal or arrested states characterized by some quasi-conserved quantities. We will also show the existence of a critical limit beyond which the prethermal plateau ceases to exist. In addition to that, such prethermalization plays a crucial role to stabilize the discrete time-crystalline phase under perturbations.", "Show?": "hide", "Image name": "NA", "Name": " Saptarshi  Saha", "Link": "", "Citations": "", "Topic": ""}, {"": "Ms.", "First Name": "Rivu ", "Surename": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "HRI", "Primary email": "rivugupta@hri.res.in", "Response": "", "Schedule": "15th June 5 to 5:30 IST", "id": "187", "Date (double click to pick)": "6/15/2023", "Time ( IST )": "17:00:00", "end": "17:30:00", "Title": "Distributed dense coding network for continuous variable systems", "Abstract": "Quantum dense coding (DC), first introduced by Bennett and Weisner for qubit systems, was generalized to the continuous variable (CV) paradigm by Braunstein and van Look for a single sender and a single receiver. In this talk, I will discuss the continuous variable dense coding (CV-DC) scheme for multiple senders sharing a multimode entangled state with a single receiver. I will present our framework for generating a multimode-dense coding network using quantum optical fields, and demonstrate the quantum advantage of the protocol using paradigmatic classes of three- and four-mode states. The protocol is scalable to arbitrary numbers of senders. The encoding operations comprise local displacements while the decoding involves homodyne measurements of the modes. Our protocol involves simple optical elements such as beam splitters and mirrors, thereby exhibiting its potentiality for experimental realization.\r\n\r\nRef:-  Quantum dense coding network using multimode squeezed states of light\r\n\r\nAyan Patra, Rivu Gupta, Saptarshi Roy, Tamoghna Das, and Aditi Sen(De)\r\n\r\nPhys.

We introduce an elegant sum-of-squares approach to derive the dimension-independent optimal quantum violation of Bell inequalities which plays a crucial role. Note that the standard Bell test cannot self-test the post-measurement states and consequently cannot self-test unsharp instrument. The sequential Bell test possess the potential to self-test an unsharp instrument. We demonstrate that there exists a trade-off between the maximum sequential quantum violations of the Clauser\u2013Horne\u2013Shimony\u2013Holt inequality, and they form an optimal pair that enables the DI self-testing of the entangled state, the observables, and the unsharpness parameter. Further, we extend our study to the case of elegant Bell inequality and we argue that it has two classical bounds\u2014the local bound and the non-trivial preparation non-contextual bound, lower than the local bound. Based on the sharing of preparation contextuality by three independent sequential observers, we demonstrate the DI self-testing of two unsharpness parameters.
